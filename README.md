Read Me file for React Contact Form.

React Contact Form -

Objective:
Create a reusable React component, that can be used on any website or application to embed a contact form on the page. The form should contain the following fileds:

- Name
- Email Address
- Telephone Number
- Message

Project Status: Incomplete

I researched and found code tutorials online and developed from there.
As I went through the code I literally retyped it and researched as I went.
This was to ensure I understood what each part did to contribute to the form.
The front end page will currently run and display with submit button.
However no data is stored in database, and no notification is sent.
Now looking to get the back end of the form working by using Apache.
Need more research in how to integrate this and will update notes as I progress.

Development notes:

Application configured in App.js file. 
Edit this to make amendments to form fields.

All formatting configured in App.css file.
Edit this to make amendments to form format/style.
